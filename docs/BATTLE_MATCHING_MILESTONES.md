### Green and Red Shell setup and movement (2026-09-08)

Thirteen Overlay 11 functions add 2,976 matching C++ bytes, reaching
456,616 / 1,563,700 bytes (29.20%). The batch covers the attack and controller
initializers, attached-effect slots, speed lookup and stepped travel time,
and support-character movement. Explicit layouts describe the 612-byte work
area, 44-byte controller, 48-byte projectile view and 28-byte support state.
The controller initializer copies four bytes of initial motion settings;
this length was recovered from the call arguments in the original instructions.

The unmodified rebuilt ROM has SHA-1
`ba4ec2f99b4f2e0047601552bccf00aa73e28701`; full linking, ROM checks,
74 tests, progress consistency and the public-content audit pass.

Runtime verification used checkpoint 83, `Star Shrine - Third area (Before boss)`,
with save SHA-1 `2cb577d3008975c390a2f00e2b2cd646e4005c1b`. The existing
Petey battle checkpoint was created with the previously documented temporary
Field-VM encounter command; these new attack runs use only ordinary button inputs.
Green Shells (configuration 1, resource `0xc0000047`) ran for 2,110 frames,
and Red Shells (configuration 0, resource `0xc0000048`) for 2,150 frames.
Both attacks returned to Luigi's command wheel. The battery save remains unchanged.

Full-function byte guards and stack-matched return hooks observed nine of the
thirteen new functions. Read-only RAM checks confirmed both controller setups,
configuration pointers, resources, initial positions, projectile readiness,
travel-time and speed results, support reset and completion of effect slots.
The effect-spawn, delayed-intercept, support-launch and speed-update paths did
not run in these unsuccessful kick sequences; their coverage is byte matching.
Private evidence is recorded in `shell_green_full83.json` and
`shell_both_check_red83.json` under `build/runtime/eur_attack_helpers/`.
