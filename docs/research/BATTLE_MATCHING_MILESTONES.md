# Battle matching milestones toward 20 percent

## Global properties, damage, and motion channels

These four European overlay-2 units reproduce all 3,320 original bytes,
including relocations and function order:

| Unit | Bytes | Implementation |
|---|---:|---|
| `battle_global_property_set.c` | 1,304 | C |
| `battle_damage_by_object.c` | 728 | C |
| `battle_damage_numbers.c` | 860 | C with one ARM instruction |
| `battle_scene_motion_stop.c` | 428 | C |

`SceneBackground_StartFade` takes both a direction and a duration. Its resident
implementation at `0x02027DB8` reads `r1`, substitutes 20 or 60 when the duration
is -1, and calculates the fixed-point fade step. The global-property setter
passes its property value through as this second argument. The previous
one-argument declaration incorrectly allowed the compiler to overwrite it.

`BattleSceneObject_StopMotionChannel` returns `void`. The C callers discard its
result, and the original assembly's exit values are temporary values from
channel scanning and stores. Removing artificial pointer/integer return values
restores the original data flow. The scan retains separate index and channel
variables, applies deferred movement in order, and clears the stopped channel.

The damage calculator converts each object ID to an actor ID in the same input
variable before looking up the actors. Those value lifetimes reproduce the
original register reuse across the two object lookups.

The damage-number cleanup callback explicitly materializes the payload address
at task + 12. One `add` in inline assembly preserves that address boundary;
the actor-ID read, actor lookup, effect check, and cleanup remain C. The other
three functions in this unit are entirely C.

Validation uses objdiff for each function, the complete module and symbol
checks, and the normal unmodified-data ROM build. The reference ROM SHA-1 is
`ba4ec2f99b4f2e0047601552bccf00aa73e28701`.

## Fixed-point coprocessor routines

The resident `fx_coprocessor.c` unit adds 680 matching bytes across eleven
functions. In `FX_InvSqrt`, the Q32 reciprocal multiplied by the Q22 square-root
result produces Q54. Returning Q12 requires adding `1 << 41` and shifting by
42. The previous expression rounded and shifted the low word by ten bits,
losing the required 32-bit scale adjustment. The corrected 64-bit C expression
reproduces the complete original multiply, carry, and arithmetic-shift sequence.

`FX_Sqrt` preserves its nonpositive-input guard and calls the C result reader.
Its seven-instruction hardware setup block (28 bytes) retains the order of
the mode write and the two operand-word writes. All other functions in this
unit are C, including the corrected inverse square root.

## VRAM bank management

Four new GX units reconstruct the complete resident range
`0x02035444..0x020364AC`: 40 functions and 4,200 bytes, entirely in C.

The 26-byte `GxVramState` records assignments for LCDC, the two engines,
textures, clear images, and extended palettes. The code initializes the bank
state and control registers, calculates capacity from bank masks, disables
and unlocks banks, moves assignments back into LCDC address space, and sets
each engine's bank mappings. The assignments preserve both mapping-slot bits
and the enable bits in the display control registers.

The background and texture switches retain the original fallthrough groups
and register-write order. The background switch's 33-entry ARM branch table
was reconstructed directly from its branch destinations; the local decompiler
did not recover that table. Unsupported masks preserve the original switch
default behavior. The shared assignment expression reads the old engine mask
and combines it with LCDC before replacing the engine mask; MWCC schedules
the independent stores in the same order as the original.

All 40 functions match at their original sizes. The whole-module and symbol
checks, reference-ROM SHA-1 check, generated-progress check, public-content
audit, and 66 tests pass for the linked milestone.
