# ARM9 overlay map

European overlay roles and the source currently linked into the matching build.
Byte counts below come from [progress.json](../progress.json), checked against
the source and link metadata on 2026-09-21.

Each fraction is **matching C/C++ bytes / mapped code bytes**. The percentage
uses that overlay's code size; separately maintained assembly is excluded.
See [the progress guide](../PROGRESS.md) for the counting rules.
The source links open each overlay's main source directory.

The named attacks above are backed by recorded in-game selections and runtime
checks in the [reconstruction milestones](../BATTLE_MATCHING_MILESTONES.md),
[battle map](BATTLE_MAP.md) and [runtime notes](RUNTIME_ANALYSIS.md).
Smash Eggs was confirmed through its menu selection, actor command 8 and
overlay 15's native entry callback. Overlay 25 holds the Elder Princess Shroob
fight; its source establishes the projectile, chain and linked-effect behavior
used there.
Runtime coverage varies by function; matching bytes do not imply every branch
has been exercised in the emulator.

## VM dispatchers

All four dispatchers are byte-identical and linked, totaling **53,700 bytes**.

| Overlay | Dispatcher | Matching bytes | Source |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Field | 23,492 | [field_vm_dispatch.cpp](../../src/field/field_vm_dispatch.cpp) |
| 2 | Battle | 19,168 | [battle_vm_dispatch.cpp](../../src/battle/battle_vm_dispatch.cpp) |
| 2 | Common battle | 1,844 | [battle_vm_common_dispatch.c](../../src/battle/battle_vm_common_dispatch.c) |
| 7 | Scene/object | 9,196 | [scene_vm_dispatch.c](../../src/scene_menu_ov007/scene_vm_dispatch.c) |

The scene dispatcher includes a 64-byte inline-assembly block for opcode
`0x04E`. Its [matching notes](SCENE_VM_MATCHING.md) explain the height
calculation. The [script VM reference](SCRIPT_VM_SEMANTICS.md) documents the
command tables and behavior. Dispatcher completion does not mean every function
called by a script command has been decompiled.

## Placeholder overlays

IDs `1`, `3`, `4`, `19`, `22`, `23`, `24`, and `27-36` contain the same 32-byte
placeholder image. They have no mapped code and are excluded from the totals.

## Updating this map

1. Check the overlay's `delinks.txt` under
   [the EUR overlay configuration](../../config/eur/arm9/overlays/) and the
   [linked-source manifest](../../config/eur/arm9/linked_sources.txt).
2. Run `python tools/generate_progress.py` from the repository root and copy
   the per-overlay counts from `docs/progress.json`.
3. Update the source summaries and cite runtime evidence when naming a newly
   identified attack or scene.

For disassembly setup, see the [IDA import guide](../../tools/ida/README.md).
For reconstruction and verification rules, see the
[source guidelines](../DECOMPILATION_STYLE.md).
