/* The game's allocator. Up to 32 numbered heaps are carved out of each other:
   creating a heap allocates a block inside a parent heap and turns it into a
   region of its own, so a scene can drop everything it allocated by destroying
   its heap instead of freeing block by block.

   Each region is a doubly linked list of blocks in address order. Every
   allocation is preceded by its own header, so GameHeap_Free recovers the
   header by stepping one GameHeapBlock back from the pointer it is given. */
